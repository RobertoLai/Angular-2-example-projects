# Angular2 projects

A series of simple projects developed mainly with the Angular2 framework.
I will upload about 15 little projects.

The ideas for the projects come from books or online courses about angularJS, Angular2, ReactJS, etc. that I read
but usually the applications are redesigned by me and differ from them.
At present they represent only my own explorations of the Angular2 framework and no quality code is to be expected from them.

I will updated them following the style guides later.


## Infos and Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular2 development.

<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.
